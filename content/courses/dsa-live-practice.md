## DSA Live Practice Series

This is a live, topic-focused practice series designed for learners who already have basic familiarity with Data Structures and Algorithms and want to strengthen their problem-solving skills through guided live sessions.

The sessions are not a structured DSA course from scratch. Instead, each live class will focus on one specific DSA concept or pattern such as recursion, trees, dynamic programming, graphs, sliding window, two pointers, and similar topics. The emphasis will be on intuition, patterns, common mistakes, and problem-solving approaches, rather than syllabus completion.

Each session is standalone, so you can attend based on your interest or weak areas without worrying about missing previous classes. Live problem solving, thought process explanation, and Q&A will be the core format.

This series is also part of the initial rollout of the Codeverra platform and will evolve based on learner feedback.
